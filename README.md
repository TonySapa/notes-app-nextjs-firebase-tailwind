It is ok for John to keep building these ones on every recruitment process. Is not ok for Tony to ignore past achievements and more complex public code that can be evaluated on his github profile. Tony is not John.

## Stack
- TypeScript
- React
- Tailwind
- NextJS
- Firebase

## Get started
Step 1: Run `yarn` to get dependencies

Step 2: Run `yarn start` app will listen on port 3000

Step 3: Do 50 sit-ups

Step 4: Relax muscles for a minute

Step 5: Do another 50 sit-ups

Check your screen.

Steps 3-5 are useless. But this "could" help you "stand out" from other recruiters that are fatter than you and may "potentially" lead to a job offer. Same as with code tasks on recruitment processes, "useless", "could", "stand out", "potentially"...
